### Lucas Kanade Method ###

In computer vision, the Lucas–Kanade method is a widely used differential method for optical flow estimation developed by Bruce D. Lucas 
and Takeo Kanade. 
It assumes that the flow is essentially constant in a local neighbourhood of the pixel under consideration, and solves the basic optical
flow equations for all the pixels in that neighbourhood, by the least squares criterion.
By combining information from several nearby pixels, the Lucas–Kanade method can often resolve the inherent ambiguity of the optical flow equation. 
It is also less sensitive to image noise than point-wise methods.
